# Toxic-Comments-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-for-Roman-Urdu
Machine learning models (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest) were used to classify Roman Urdu comments as toxic or non-toxic. Decision Tree and Random Forest showed high accuracy and balance, effectively detecting toxic comments and handling complex patterns in the text.

# Toxic Comments Detection using Machine Learning for Roman Urdu

This project uses machine learning to classify Roman Urdu comments as toxic or non-toxic using three models: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

## üìå Project Highlights

- Preprocessed a Roman Urdu dataset of comments.
- Applied NLP techniques and feature engineering.
- Trained and evaluated ML models: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Measured performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
- Decision Tree and Random Forest performed with high accuracy and generalization.

## üìÅ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kashif7723/Toxic-Comments-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-for-Roman-Urdu.git

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook toxic_comments_detection.ipynb

3. Run all cells to preprocess data, train models, and view evaluation metrics.

4.  Google API Setup (Optional - For YouTube Comments)
To fetch Roman Urdu comments directly from YouTube using the YouTube Data API:

  4.1  Go to the Google Cloud Console and create a new project.

  4.2  Enable YouTube Data API v3.

  4.3  Generate an API key and paste it into the notebook

  4.4  Use the API to extract comments from YouTube videos for analysis.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not commit or share your API key publicly.

üöÄ Future Improvements
Expand the dataset with more labeled Roman Urdu data.

Integrate deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT).

Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask.
